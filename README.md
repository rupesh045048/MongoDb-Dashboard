## Interpretation 

All regions show a decreasing trend in TB prevalence, with Africa (AFR) initially having the highest prevalence and witnessing a significant but slower decline compared to other regions. South-East Asia (SEA) demonstrates a steeper decline over time.

The stacked bar shows a proportional decline in TB prevalence across all regions over time, with Africa and South-East Asia remaining major contributors.

HIV-TB co-infections are most severe in Africa, which shows the highest counts over all time periods, correlating with the HIV epidemic in the region.

South-East Asia has the largest population but shows a relatively lower burden when normalized. Africa, despite a smaller population, has a disproportionately high TB burden.

Africa remains the most affected in terms of TB-related deaths, although there is a visible decline in fatalities across most regions over time.

India stands out with the highest TB mortality, nearly double that of the second highest (Nigeria), indicating a critical area for intervention.
