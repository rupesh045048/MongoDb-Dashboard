## Interpretation 

All regions show a decreasing trend in TB prevalence, with Africa (AFR) initially having the highest prevalence and witnessing a significant but slower decline compared to other regions. South-East Asia (SEA) demonstrates a steeper decline over time.

The stacked bar shows a proportional decline in TB prevalence across all regions over time, with Africa and South-East Asia remaining major contributors.

HIV-TB co-infections are most severe in Africa, which shows the highest counts over all time periods, correlating with the HIV epidemic in the region.

South-East Asia has the largest population but shows a relatively lower burden when normalized. Africa, despite a smaller population, has a disproportionately high TB burden.

Africa remains the most affected in terms of TB-related deaths, although there is a visible decline in fatalities across most regions over time.

India stands out with the highest TB mortality, nearly double that of the second highest (Nigeria), indicating a critical area for intervention.


## Key Insights:
Global Decline: TB prevalence, incidence, and mortality show a consistent decline across all regions, reflecting improved healthcare and TB control measures.
Regional Burden: Africa and South-East Asia contribute the largest share of TB burden, with Africa leading in HIV-associated TB cases and TB deaths.
HIV Co-Infection: HIV significantly exacerbates TB cases in regions with high HIV prevalence, particularly in Africa.
Population Dynamics: Higher population regions like South-East Asia manage their TB burden more effectively than smaller population regions like Africa.
Country-Level Insights: Indiaâ€™s TB mortality outpaces other countries, signaling a need for targeted national interventions.

## Conclusion:
The dataset and dashboard provide a comprehensive view of the global TB burden, highlighting progress in reducing prevalence and mortality while underscoring persistent regional challenges. Key focus areas include addressing the HIV-TB synergy in Africa, reinforcing TB programs in high-burden countries like India, and scaling global efforts to eliminate TB as a public health threat.
